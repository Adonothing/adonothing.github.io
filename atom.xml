Although the bearing-only approach has been studied for decades, a <em>fundamental limitation</em> of this approach is that it requires extra lateral motion of the observer to enhance the target’s observability. Unfortunately, the extra lateral motion conflicts with the desired motion of the observer in many tasks.<br>It is well-known that, once a target has been detected in an image, a bounding box that surrounds the target can be obtained.<br>Surprisingly, this common visual measurement especially its size information has not been well explored up to now.<br>In this paper, we propose a new <em>bearing-angle</em> approach to estimate the motion of a target by modeling its image bounding box as bearing-angle measurements.<br>Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that this approach can significantly enhance the observability <em>without</em> relying on additional lateral motion of the observer.<br>The benefit of the bearing-angle approach comes with no additional cost because a bounding box is a standard output of object detection algorithms.<br>The approach simply exploits the information that has not been fully exploited in the past.<br>No additional sensing devices or special detection algorithms are required.</p><h1>Keywords</h1><p>Bearing-only target motion estimation, Pseudo-linear Kalman filter, Observability enhancement</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>  This paper studies the problem of estimating the motion of a moving target object using a moving monocular camera. The target’s geometric information such as its physical size is <em>unknown</em> in advance. This problem is important in many fields .<br>Our present work is particularly motivated by the task of aerial target pursuit, where a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) uses its onboard camera to detect, localize, and then pursue another flying MAV.<br>The task of aerial target pursuit, originally motivated by the interesting bird-catching-bird behaviors in nature , potentially provides an effective approach to the defense of misused MAV .</p><figure id="fig_architecture_outdoor"></figure><p><img src="https://picture.adunas.top/Article/arXiv-2401.17117v1/fig_architecture_outdoor.png" alt="An observer MAV observes a target MAV with a monocular camera. The bearing $g$ and angle $\theta$ can be obtained from the bounding box that surrounds the target in the image."></p><p>  When a target has been detected in an image by a vision detection algorithm, we usually obtain a <em>bounding box</em> that surrounds the target’s image (see Fig. <a href="#fig_architecture_outdoor">1</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_architecture_outdoor”}).<br>The bounding box carries two types of useful information that can be used to estimate the target’s motion.</p><p>  The first type of useful information is the <em>center point</em> of the bounding box.<br>The pixel coordinate of the center point can be used to calculate the spatial <em>bearing vector</em> pointing from the camera to the target based on the pin-hole camera model [@Ma2012].<br>Using the bearing vector to estimate the target’s motion is referred to as <em>bearing-only</em> target motion estimation [@Fogel1988; @He2019; @Li2022].<br>As a problem that has been studied for more than 40 years, bearing-only target motion estimation was originally studied to estimate the motion of ships on the ocean surface [@hoelzer1978modified], and regained increasing research attention in recent years in vision-based target estimation tasks [@Ponda2009; @Anjaly2018; @He2019].</p><p>  Bearing-only target motion estimation requires an <em>observability condition</em>: The observer must have higher-order motion than the target and, more importantly, the higher-order motion must contain components that are orthogonal to the target’s bearing vector [@Fogel1988].<br>Motivated by this observability condition, enormous works have studied how an observer should move to enhance the observability [@Hammel1989; @Sabet2016; @Anjaly2018; @He2019].<br>For instance, in our recent work [@Li2022], we proposed a helical guidance law so that a MAV moves along a helical curve to optimize the observability in the 3D space.</p><p>  A <em>limitation</em> of the observability condition of the classic bearing-only approach is that the observer must move in the lateral directions that are orthogonal to the bearing vector of the target.<br>Such additional lateral motion is usually unfavorable because it may conflict with the desired motion of the observer in many tasks.<br>For example, in an aerial target pursuit task, the pursuer is desired to approach the target as fast as possible and then keep stationary relative to the target. Then, the additional lateral motion would conflict with the desired motion.<br>It is, therefore, important to study other ways that can enhance the observability while avoiding unfavorable lateral motion.</p><p>  The second type of useful information of a bounding box is its <em>size</em> (either width or height).<br>The size of a bounding box is jointly determined by several factors such as the target’s distance, the target’s physical size, and the orientation of the camera.<br>The target’s physical size is usually unknown in many tasks, especially in those antagonistic ones such as aerial pursuit of misused MAVs.<br>As a result, the size of the bounding box cannot directly infer the target’s distance.<br>Nevertheless, it carries valuable information for localizing the target.</p><p>  Surprisingly, the size information of the bounding box has not been well explored so far.<br>The work that is closely relevant to ours is the state-of-the-art one in [@Griffin2021], where the size of a bounding box is used to localize unknown target objects.<br>Although the approach in [@Griffin2021] is inspiring, it relies on two assumptions: The target objects are stationary and the camera can only translate without rotating.<br>It is still an open problem how to estimate a target’s motion when the two assumptions are not valid.<br>Moreover, the theoretical role of the size of a bounding box in target motion estimation has not been fully understood so far.<br>Although the work in [@Vrba2020] also utilizes the size of the bounding box to estimate the target’s position, it is assumed that the target’s physical size is known in advance.</p><p>  Estimating the motion of moving objects is also a fundamental problem in dynamic SLAM.<br>For example, the works in [@Yang2019; @Qiu2019] firstly estimate the camera’s pose and secondly estimate the target object’s pose subject to a scale factor, and finally estimate the scale factor from multi-view measurements.<br>To estimate the target object’s pose subject to a scale factor, [@Yang2019] and [@Qiu2019] rely on detecting, respectively, a 3D bounding box and sufficient feature points inside the 2D bounding box.<br>Different from [@Yang2019; @Qiu2019], our proposed approach merely utilizes a 2D image bounding box without further extracting feature points or a 3D bounding box inside the 2D bounding box.<br>As a result, one benefit is that this approach is more computationally efficient.<br>Moreover, this approach can handle the challenging small-target case where the target object is far and hence its image is small.<br>In this case, it would be unreliable to extract sufficient stable features or conduct 3D detection.</p><p>  The aforementioned approaches in [@Griffin2021; @Yang2019; @Qiu2019] are all based on multiple views.<br>It is also possible to estimate the target’s depth from a single view/image [@Tekin2018; @Vrba2020].<br>The single-view approach however requires prior information of the objects.<br>Moreover, it would be unable to successfully localize target objects with different sizes but similar appearances.<br>In this paper, we focus on the multi-view case.</p><p>  In this paper, we propose a novel <em>bearing-angle</em> target motion estimation approach that models a bounding box as bearing-angle measurements.<br>This approach can enhance the observability by fully exploiting the information in a bounding box rather than relying on the additional lateral motion of the observer.<br>The benefit of the proposed bearing-angle approach comes with no additional cost since the bounding box is a standard output of object detection algorithms.<br>The approach simply exploits the angle information that has not been fully exploited in the past.<br>No additional sensing devices or special detection algorithms are required.</p><p>  The technical novelties of this approach are threefold.</p><p>1) The proposed approach does not directly use the size of a bounding box because the size is variant to the orientation of the camera.<br>That is, even if the target’s relative position is unchanged, the size of the bounding box still varies when the camera rotates.<br>Motivated by this problem, we convert the size of the bounding box to an angle subtended by the target (see Fig. <a href="#fig_architecture_outdoor">1</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_architecture_outdoor”}).<br>The merit of using the angle measurement is that it is <em>invariant</em> to the camera’s orientation change (see Fig. <a href="#fig_cam_rotate">2</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_cam_rotate”}) and hence can greatly facilitate the estimator design.<br>In this way, the assumption in [@Griffin2021] that the camera can only translate but not rotate can be avoided.</p><p>2) Although the bearing-angle approach incorporates an additional angle measurement, it is nontrivial to see how to properly use this measurement because the angle does not directly infer the target’s distance given that the target’s size is unknown.<br>We notice that the angle is a joint nonlinear function of the target’s physical size and relative distance.<br>Hence, the state vector, which only consists of the target’s position and velocity in the conventional bearing-only approach, is augmented by the unknown target’s physical size.<br>Since the bearing and angle measurements are all nonlinear functions of the target’s state, we establish a pseudo-linear Kalman filter to properly utilize the measurements to enhance estimation stability.<br>Both simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.</p><p>3) Although an additional angle measurement is used, an additional unknown, the target’s physical size, is also introduced into the estimator.<br>It is, therefore, nontrivial to see how the additional angle measurement can help improve the observability.<br>Motivated by this problem, we prove the necessary and sufficient observability condition for bearing-angle target motion estimation.<br>In particular, we show that the target’s motion can be recovered if and only if the observer has a higher-order motion than the target.<br>Different from the bearing-only case, the higher-order motion is <em>not</em> required to be in the lateral directions that are orthogonal to the bearing vector.<br>This is an important enhancement of the observability.

In this paper, $\ell$ is assumed to be constant or varying slowly, which means that the physical size of the target object should be approximately invariant from different viewing angles. Here, $\ell$ corresponds to $\theta$, which further corresponds to either the width or height of the bounding box. Whether $\ell$ should correspond to the width or height depends on in which dimension the physical size of the target object is invariant when viewed from different angles.<br>More explanation is given in Section [4.2](#Dynamic modeling of target’s physical size){reference-type=“ref” reference=“Dynamic modeling of target’s physical size”}.</p><p>Different from the bearing-only case where the state merely consists of the position and velocity, the state here is augmented by the target’s physical size. This is due to the fact that the angle measurement is a function of the target’s physical size, which should be estimated as well. One may wonder whether the state vector can also incorporate the target’s acceleration. To estimate high-order motion (e.g., acceleration) of the target, the observer must have higher-order motion (e.g., nonzero jerk) according to the observability condition presented in Section [6](#Observability Analysis by Solving Linear Equations){reference-type=“ref” reference=“Observability Analysis by Solving Linear Equations”}. Otherwise, the estimation would diverge. Therefore, it is preferred to exclude the acceleration and merely estimate the position and velocity.</p><p>If no information of the target’s motion is available, it is common to model the target’s motion as a discrete-time noise-driven double integrator:<br>$$\begin{aligned}<br>\label{eq_state_transition}<br>{x}(t_{k+1})={F}{x}(t_k) +{q}(t_k) ,<br>\end{aligned}$$<br>where<br>$$\begin{aligned}<br>\label{eq_matrix_A}<br>{F}=<br>\begin{bmatrix}<br>{I}<em>{3\times3} &amp; \delta t{I}</em>{3\times3} &amp; {0}<em>{3\times1}  \<br>{0}</em>{3\times3} &amp; {I}<em>{3\times3}  &amp; {0}</em>{3\times1}   \<br>{0}<em>{1\times 3} &amp; {0}</em>{1\times 3} &amp; 1<br>\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{7\times 7},<br>\end{aligned}$$<br>with $\delta t$ as the sampling time, and ${I}$ and ${0}$ as the identity and zero matrices, respectively.<br>Here, ${q} \in\mathbb{R}^7$ is a zero-mean process noise satisfying ${q} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,{\Sigma}<em>q)$, where the covariance matrix is<br>$$\begin{aligned}<br>{\Sigma}<em>q=\text{diag}(0, 0, 0, \sigma_v^2, \sigma_v^2, \sigma_v^2, \sigma</em>\ell^2)\in\mathbb{R}^{7\times7}.<br>\end{aligned}$$<br>Here, $\sigma_v\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma</em>\ell\in\mathbb{R}$ are the standard deviations of the target’s velocity and size, respectively.<br>When the target’s shape is irregular, $\ell$ may vary when viewed from different angles.<br>By letting $\sigma_\ell\ne0$, we can handle the case where $\ell$ varies slowly.<br>The dynamic modeling of $\ell$ is discussed in the following subsection.</p><h2 id="Dynamic-modeling-of-target’s-physical-size">Dynamic modeling of target’s physical size</h2><p>  Since the target’s physical size $\ell$ is a state variable to be estimated, it is important to discuss its dynamic model. In fact, the dynamic model of $\ell$ in <a href="#eq_state_transition">[eq_state_transition]</a>{reference-type=“eqref” reference=“eq_state_transition”} assumes that $\ell$ varies slowly. We next justify this modeling and provide more discussion.</p><p>First of all, $\ell$ corresponds to the physical size of the target object in the dimension that is orthogonal to the bearing vector. Its dynamics can be categorized into three cases.</p><p><em>1) $\ell$ is invariant.</em><br>In theory, when $\ell$ is invariant, a change of $\theta$ implies a change of $r$.<br>As a result, the measurement of $\theta$ can help improve the system’s observability, as proven in Section [6](#Observability Analysis by Solving Linear Equations){reference-type=“ref” reference=“Observability Analysis by Solving Linear Equations”}.<br>An ideal case where $\ell$ is invariant is that the target object is a sphere or cylinder so that $\ell$ corresponds to its diameter [@Vrba2020].<br>In practice, the target object does not have to be the ideal case. For example, consider an autonomous driving scenario where a focal vehicle uses a camera to localize its surrounding vehicles in the 2D plane.<br>Although the physical size of a surrounding vehicle changes greatly when viewed from behind or side, the height of the vehicle is <em>invariant</em> from different side-view angles.<br>In this case, $\ell$ corresponds to the height of the vehicle, and we need to use the height of the image bounding box to calculate $\theta$.</p><p><em>2) $\ell$ varies slowly.</em><br>If there does not exist any dimension in which the physical size of the target remains invariant, $\ell$ may vary slowly when the target is viewed from different angles. For example, in the tasks of aerial target pursuit, if the target is a quadcopter or hexacopter, then $\ell$ is approximately equal to the wheelbase but may vary slightly when viewed from different angles since the MAV is not a perfect cylinder.<br>In this case, $\ell$ corresponds to the wheelbase of the MAV, and we need to use the width of the image bounding box to calculate $\theta$.</p><p>If $\ell$ varies slowly, it can still be treated as invariant within short time intervals.<br>As long as the observability condition (Section [6](#Observability Analysis by Solving Linear Equations){reference-type=“ref” reference=“Observability Analysis by Solving Linear Equations”}) is satisfied, the motion of the target as well as $\ell$ can be successfully estimated.<br>This fact is supported by the experimental results in Section [8.4](#Scenario 2: Circular motion and varying $\ell$){reference-type=“ref” reference=“Scenario 2: Circular motion and varying $\ell$”}.<br>It is however worth nothing that the performance of the proposed bearing-angle approach would degenerate to the conventional bearing-only one because the additional information brought by $\theta$ is used to estimate the time-varying $\ell$ rather than helping improve the system’s observability.</p><p><em>3) $\ell$ varies rapidly.</em><br>If $\ell$ varies rapidly due to certain reasons, it would be difficult to distinguish whether the change of $\theta$ is caused by the change of $\ell$ or the change of $r$.<br>For example, when a MAV is used to track a ground vehicle, $\ell$ in any dimension may vary rapidly when the relative motion between the MAV and the ground vehicle is highly dynamic.<br>In such scenarios, the additional information brought by $\theta$ is no longer sufficient to estimate the rapidly varying $\ell$ in this case. Additional visual information such as a 3D bounding box that indicates the target’s 3D attitude is required. This is an important topic for future research but out of the scope of the present paper.</p><h2 id="Nonlinear-measurement-equations">Nonlinear measurement equations</h2><p>The bearing vector $g$ and the subtended angle $\theta$ are both nonlinear functions of the target’s position.

This approximation is accurate.<br>Specifically, when $r&gt;3\ell$, which is common in practice, it can be verified that the approximation error is less than $0.08%$.

Since the ground truth of the target’s image is known in the simulation, the generated bounding box is tight.<br>The collected dataset contains 17,000 labeled images (see Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_dataset">[fig_airsim_dataset]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_dataset”}).<br>The resolution of the images is $1536\times 864$ pixels.<br>The simulation system was deployed on a Dell Precision 7920 Tower Workstation with two NVIDIA Quadro GV100 graphic cards.<br>Since the dataset is sufficient and high-quality, the detection can achieve the accuracy of mAP=99.5%.</p><h2 id="Scenario-1-Approaching-and-following-the-target">Scenario 1: Approaching and following the target</h2><p>We first consider the scenarios where the observer MAV approaches or follows a target MAV.<br>These scenarios widely exist in practical applications such as aerial target pursuit.</p><p>We show two simulation examples in Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_1">[fig_airsim_1]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_1”} and Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_2">[fig_airsim_2]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_2”}, respectively.<br>In both examples, the observer is controlled by a controller so that it can approach the target and maintain a desired separation. In particular, the controller is<br>$$\begin{aligned}<br>\label{eq_tracking_control}<br>v_o^\text{cmd}(t)&amp;=v_T(t)+k^\text{track}\dfrac{r^2(t)-r_d^2}{r^2(t)}g(t),<br>\end{aligned}$$<br>where $v_o^\text{cmd}(t)$ is the velocity command of the observer MAV, $k^\text{track}=3$ is the control gain, and $r_d=3$ is the desired separation.<br>The magnitude of the observer’s velocity is bounded from above by $3$ m/s.<br>It should be noted that <a href="#eq_tracking_control">[eq_tracking_control]</a>{reference-type=“eqref” reference=“eq_tracking_control”} relies on the true position and velocity of the target MAV in the simulation. Therefore, the data is collected first and then processed offline so that we can compare the performances of the bearing-only and bearing-angle approaches.</p><p>In the first example, the target MAV hovers constantly at $p_T(t_0)=[0, 10, 10]^\mathrm{T}$.<br>The observer MAV moves along a straight line toward the target with a decreasing velocity command.<br>Since the bearing of the target MAV remains the same, this example is challenging for the bearing-only approach.<br>As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_1">[fig_airsim_1]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_1”}, the bearing-only approach fails to converge while the bearing-angle approach can successfully estimate the target’s motion.</p><p>In the second example, the target MAV moves with a constant velocity of $v_T=[1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{2}, 0]^\mathrm{T}$.<br>The trajectory of the observer MAV under the control of <a href="#eq_tracking_control">[eq_tracking_control]</a>{reference-type=“eqref” reference=“eq_tracking_control”} is still close to (though not strictly) a straight line. As a result, the observability is weak by the bearing-only approach.<br>As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_2">[fig_airsim_2]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_2”}, the bearing-angle approach successfully converges while the bearing-only one fails.<br>It is notable that $\ell$ is invariant in the first example and varies slowly in the second example.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the detection results used in the estimation algorithms are obtained from the Yolo-based estimator.<br>The ground truth obtained from AirSim is only used to calculate the errors of measurements, as shown in the right figures of Figs. <a href="#fig_airsim_1">[fig_airsim_1]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_1”} and <a href="#fig_airsim_2">[fig_airsim_2]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_2”}.<br>It is not surprising that the measurement noises are not strictly Gaussian since the 2D bounding box is generated by a deep learning vision algorithm. It is noticed that the noises are inversely correlated to the observer-target range.<br>This is reasonable because, when the target is close to the camera and hence its image is large, the center point and the size of the bounding box usually vary for a few pixels.</p><p>The NEES values are also shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim">[fig_airsim]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim”}.<br>As can be seen, the NEES value of the bearing-only approach diverges. The NEES value of the bearing-angle approach oscillates and converges slowly. The reasons are analyzed as follows. Compared to the Matlab-based numerical simulation, the visual measurements here are generated by deep learning algorithms, and the measurement noises are non-Gaussian. The non-Gaussian noises propagate into $P$ in <a href="#eq_nees">[eq_nees]</a>{reference-type=“eqref” reference=“eq_nees”} since the calculation of $P$ relies on noisy measurements. The noises may also cause an estimation bias that can further aggravate the NEES error. Moreover, although the system is observable in the two simulation examples, the observability is relatively weak compared to the case where the observer moves surrounding the target. As a result, the matrix $P$ may not be able to perfectly describe the estimation accuracy. These elements may jointly cause the convergence behavior of the NEES values shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim">[fig_airsim]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim”}.</p><h2 id="Scenario-2-Circular-motion-and-varying-ell">Scenario 2: Circular motion and varying $\ell$</h2><p>We next examine a case where $\ell$ is time-varying.<br>In particular, suppose a target quadcopter MAV hovers constantly at $p_T(t_0)=[0, 10, 10]^\mathrm{T}$.<br>The observer MAV moves on a circle centered at the target (Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_6_1">[fig_airsim_6_1]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_6_1”}).<br>Since the target quadcopter MAV has a square shape from the top view, its size $\ell$ is time-varying when viewed from side angles (see the red curves in the middle subfigure of Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_6_1">[fig_airsim_6_1]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_6_1”}).</p><p>We show two simulation examples in Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_6_1">[fig_airsim_6_1]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_6_1”} and Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_6_2">[fig_airsim_6_2]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_6_2”}, respectively.<br>The two simulation examples share the same measurement data but different values of $\sigma_\ell$.<br>Moreover, the other parameters are the same as those in Section [8.3](#Scenario 1: Approaching and following the target){reference-type=“ref” reference=“Scenario 1: Approaching and following the target”}.</p><p>::: figure*<br>:::</p><p>In the first simulation example, $\sigma_\ell$ is set to be a small value: $\sigma_\ell=10^{-4}$.<br>Its interpretation is that $\ell$ is treated as invariant during the process.<br>In this case, the performance of the bearing-angle approach is almost the same as the bearing-only one as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_airsim_6_1">[fig_airsim_6_1]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_airsim_6_1”}.<br>Since $\ell$ is treated to be invariant, the estimated value $\hat{\ell}$ converges to a constant which is the mean value of the time-varying $\ell$.</p><p>In the second simulation example, the value of $\sigma_\ell$ is larger than the first example: $\sigma_\ell = 0.01$.<br>Its interpretation is that $\ell$ is believed to be time-varying during the process.<br>In this case, the performance of the bearing-angle approach is still almost the same as the bearing-only one.<br>Moreover, since $\sigma_\ell$ is large, the bearing-angle approach can successfully estimate the true time-varying value of $\ell$.</p><p>In summary, in the case where $\ell$ varies slowly, the bearing-angle approach would degenerate to the bearing-only one.<br>The fundamental reason is that the extra information embedded in the angle measurement is used to estimate the time-varying $\ell$ rather than improving the observability of the target’s motion.</p><p>::: figure*<br>:::</p><h1>Real-World Experimental Results</h1><p>In this section, two sets of real-world experiments are presented to further verify the effectiveness of the approach.

Initially, the observer MAV is placed about 20 meters behind the target MAV on the ground. Then, the two MAVs take off and fly to the same specified height automatically upon a takeoff command sent from the ground control station.<br>After they have reached the desired height, all deployed algorithms are activated.<br>Then, the target MAV moves with a constant velocity of $v_T=[1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{2}, 0]^\mathrm{T}$.

Instead, the control is based on the measurements provided by the RKT GPS and inter-MAV wireless communication. In this way, we can analyze the image and flight data offline and compare the performance of the two approaches of bearing-angle and bearing-only.<br>The acquired images and flight data are saved on the onboard computer during the flight. A dataset of 5,341 images was collected (Fig. <a href="#fig_M300_dataset">[fig_M300_dataset]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_M300_dataset”}) and used to train a tiny-YOLO v4 network.<br>The detection precision of the trained network reaches mAP=99.8%.</p><p>The experimental results are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_outdoor_1">[fig_outdoor_1]</a>{reference-type=“ref” reference=“fig_outdoor_1”}.<br>As can be seen, the bearing-angle approach performs well. By contrast, the bearing-only approach only works well before the observer MAV reached the desired position relative to the target MAV.

Although the bearing-only approach has been studied for decades, a <em>fundamental limitation</em> of this approach is that it requires extra lateral motion of the observer to enhance the target’s observability. Unfortunately, the extra lateral motion conflicts with the desired motion of the observer in many tasks.<br>It is well-known that, once a target has been detected in an image, a bounding box that surrounds the target can be obtained.<br>Surprisingly, this common visual measurement especially its size information has not been well explored up to now.<br>In this paper, we propose a new <em>bearing-angle</em> approach to estimate the motion of a target by modeling its image bounding box as bearing-angle measurements.<br>Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that this approach can significantly enhance the observability <em>without</em> relying on additional lateral motion of the observer.<br>The benefit of the bearing-angle approach comes with no additional cost because a bounding box is a standard output of object detection algorithms.<br>The approach simply exploits the information that has not been fully exploited in the past.<br>No additional sensing devices or special detection algorithms are required.</p><h2 id="Keywords">Keywords</h2><p>Bearing-only target motion estimation, Pseudo-linear Kalman filter, Observability enhancement</p><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p>  This paper studies the problem of estimating the motion of a moving target object using a moving monocular camera. The target’s geometric information such as its physical size is <em>unknown</em> in advance. This problem is important in many fields<!--  \citep{Qiu2019, Griffin2021, Tekin2018} -->.<br>Our present work is particularly motivated by the task of aerial target pursuit, where a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) uses its onboard camera to detect, localize, and then pursue another flying MAV.<br>The task of aerial target pursuit, originally motivated by the interesting bird-catching-bird behaviors in nature<!--  \citep{Brighton2019} -->, potentially provides an effective approach to the defense of misused MAV<!--  \citep{Rothe2019, Dressel2019, Vrba2020} -->.</p><p><a id= "fig_architecture_outdoor"></a><br><img src="https://picture.adunas.top/Article/arXiv-2401.17117v1/fig_architecture_outdoor.png" alt="Fig.1 An observer MAV observes a target MAV with a monocular camera. The bearing $g$ and angle $\theta$ can be obtained from the bounding box that surrounds the target in the image."></p><p>  When a target has been detected in an image by a vision detection algorithm, we usually obtain a <em>bounding box</em> that surrounds the target’s image (see <a href="#fig_architecture_outdoor">Fig.1</a>).<br>The bounding box carries two types of useful information that can be used to estimate the target’s motion.</p><p>  The first type of useful information is the <em>center point</em> of the bounding box.<br>The pixel coordinate of the center point can be used to calculate the spatial <em>bearing vector</em> pointing from the camera to the target based on the pin-hole camera model<!--  \citep{Ma2012} -->.<br>Using the bearing vector to estimate the target’s motion is referred to as <em>bearing-only</em> target motion estimation<!--  \citep{Fogel1988, He2019, Li2022} -->.<br>As a problem that has been studied for more than 40 years, bearing-only target motion estimation was originally studied to estimate the motion of ships on the ocean surface<!--  \citep{hoelzer1978modified} -->, and regained increasing research attention in recent years in vision-based target estimation tasks<!--  \citep{Ponda2009, Anjaly2018, He2019} -->.</p><p>  Bearing-only target motion estimation requires an <em>observability condition</em>: The observer must have higher-order motion than the target and, more importantly, the higher-order motion must contain components that are orthogonal to the target’s bearing vector<!--  \citep{Fogel1988} -->.<br>Motivated by this observability condition, enormous works have studied how an observer should move to enhance the observability<!--  \citep{Hammel1989, Sabet2016, Anjaly2018, He2019} -->.<br>For instance, in our recent work<!--  \citep{Li2022} -->, we proposed a helical guidance law so that a MAV moves along a helical curve to optimize the observability in the 3D space.</p><p>  A <em>limitation</em> of the observability condition of the classic bearing-only approach is that the observer must move in the lateral directions that are orthogonal to the bearing vector of the target.<br>Such additional lateral motion is usually unfavorable because it may conflict with the desired motion of the observer in many tasks.<br>For example, in an aerial target pursuit task, the pursuer is desired to approach the target as fast as possible and then keep stationary relative to the target. Then, the additional lateral motion would conflict with the desired motion.<br>It is, therefore, important to study other ways that can enhance the observability while avoiding unfavorable lateral motion.</p><p>  The second type of useful information of a bounding box is its <em>size</em> (either width or height).<br>The size of a bounding box is jointly determined by several factors such as the target’s distance, the target’s physical size, and the orientation of the camera.<br>The target’s physical size is usually unknown in many tasks, especially in those antagonistic ones such as aerial pursuit of misused MAVs.<br>As a result, the size of the bounding box cannot directly infer the target’s distance.<br>Nevertheless, it carries valuable information for localizing the target.</p><p>  Surprisingly, the size information of the bounding box has not been well explored so far.<br>The work that is closely relevant to ours is the state-of-the-art one in<!--  \citep{Griffin2021} -->, where the size of a bounding box is used to localize unknown target objects.<br>Although the approach in<!--  \citep{Griffin2021} --> is inspiring, it relies on two assumptions: The target objects are stationary and the camera can only translate without rotating.<br>It is still an open problem how to estimate a target’s motion when the two assumptions are not valid.<br>Moreover, the theoretical role of the size of a bounding box in target motion estimation has not been fully understood so far.<br>Although the work in<!--  \citep{Vrba2020} --> also utilizes the size of the bounding box to estimate the target’s position, it is assumed that the target’s physical size is known in advance.</p><p>  Estimating the motion of moving objects is also a fundamental problem in dynamic SLAM.<br>For example, the works in<!--  \citep{Yang2019,Qiu2019} --> firstly estimate the camera’s pose and secondly estimate the target object’s pose subject to a scale factor, and finally estimate the scale factor from multi-view measurements.<br>To estimate the target object’s pose subject to a scale factor,<!--  \citep{Yang2019} --> and<!--  \citep{Qiu2019} --> rely on detecting, respectively, a 3D bounding box and sufficient feature points inside the 2D bounding box.<br>Different from<!--  \citep{Yang2019,Qiu2019} -->, our proposed approach merely utilizes a 2D image bounding box without further extracting feature points or a 3D bounding box inside the 2D bounding box.<br>As a result, one benefit is that this approach is more computationally efficient.<br>Moreover, this approach can handle the challenging small-target case where the target object is far and hence its image is small.<br>In this case, it would be unreliable to extract sufficient stable features or conduct 3D detection.</p><p>  The aforementioned approaches in<!--  \citep{Griffin2021,Yang2019,Qiu2019} --> are all based on multiple views.<br>It is also possible to estimate the target’s depth from a single view/image<!--  \citep{Tekin2018, Vrba2020} -->.<br>The single-view approach however requires prior information of the objects.<br>Moreover, it would be unable to successfully localize target objects with different sizes but similar appearances.<br>In this paper, we focus on the multi-view case.</p><p>  In this paper, we propose a novel <em>bearing-angle</em> target motion estimation approach that models a bounding box as bearing-angle measurements.<br>This approach can enhance the observability by fully exploiting the information in a bounding box rather than relying on the additional lateral motion of the observer.<br>The benefit of the proposed bearing-angle approach comes with no additional cost since the bounding box is a standard output of object detection algorithms.<br>The approach simply exploits the angle information that has not been fully exploited in the past.<br>No additional sensing devices or special detection algorithms are required.</p><p>  The technical novelties of this approach are threefold.</p><ol><li><p>The proposed approach does not directly use the size of a bounding box because the size is variant to the orientation of the camera.<br>That is, even if the target’s relative position is unchanged, the size of the bounding box still varies when the camera rotates.<br>Motivated by this problem, we convert the size of the bounding box to an angle subtended by the target (see <a href="#fig_architecture_outdoor">Fig.1</a>).<br>The merit of using the angle measurement is that it is <em>invariant</em> to the camera’s orientation change (see <a href="#fig_cam_rotate">Fig.2</a>) and hence can greatly facilitate the estimator design.<br>In this way, the assumption in<!--

nontrivial to see how to properly use this measurement because the angle does not directly infer the target’s distance given that the target’s size is unknown.<br>We notice that the angle is a joint nonlinear function of the target’s physical size and relative distance.<br>Hence, the state vector, which only consists of the target’s position and velocity in the conventional bearing-only approach, is augmented by the unknown target’s physical size.<br>Since the bearing and angle measurements are all nonlinear functions of the target’s state, we establish a pseudo-linear Kalman filter to properly utilize the measurements to enhance estimation stability.<br>Both simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.</p></li><li><p>Although an additional angle measurement is used, an additional unknown, the target’s physical size, is also introduced into the estimator.<br>It is, therefore, nontrivial to see how the additional angle measurement can help improve the observability.<br>Motivated by this problem, we prove the necessary and sufficient observability condition for bearing-angle target motion estimation.<br>In particular, we show that the target’s motion can be recovered if and only if the observer has a higher-order motion than the target.<br>Different from the bearing-only case, the higher-order motion is <em>not</em> required to be in the lateral directions that are orthogonal to the bearing vector.<br>This is an important enhancement of the observability.

In this paper, $\ell$ is assumed to be constant or varying slowly, which means that the physical size of the target object should be approximately invariant from different viewing angles. Here, $\ell$ corresponds to $\theta$, which further corresponds to either the width or height of the bounding box. Whether $\ell$ should correspond to the width or height depends on in which dimension the physical size of the target object is invariant when viewed from different angles.<br>More explanation is given in Section~\ref{sec_dynamical_model_of_size}.</p><p>  Different from the bearing-only case where the state merely consists of the position and velocity, the state here is augmented by the target’s physical size. This is due to the fact that the angle measurement is a function of the target’s physical size, which should be estimated as well. One may wonder whether the state vector can also incorporate the target’s acceleration. To estimate high-order motion (e.g., acceleration) of the target, the observer must have higher-order motion (e.g., nonzero jerk) according to the observability condition presented in Section~\ref{sec_observability_criteria}. Otherwise, the estimation would diverge. Therefore, it is preferred to exclude the acceleration and merely estimate the position and velocity.</p><p>  If no information of the target’s motion is available, it is common to model the target’s motion as a discrete-time noise-driven double integrator:</p><p>$$<br>\begin{align}<br>x(t_{k+1})=Fx(t_k) +q(t_k) ,<br>\end{align}<br>$$\label{eq_state_transition}</p><p>where</p><p>$$<br>\begin{align}<br>F=<br>\begin{bmatrix}<br>I_{3\times3} &amp; \delta tI_{3\times3} &amp; 0_{3\times1}  \<br>0_{3\times3} &amp; I_{3\times3}  &amp; 0_{3\times1}   \<br>0_{1\times 3} &amp; 0_{1\times 3} &amp; 1<br>\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{7\times 7},<br>\end{align}<br>$$\label{eq_matrix_A}</p><p>with $\delta t$ as the sampling time, and $I$ and $0$ as the identity and zero matrices, respectively.<br>Here, $q \in\mathbb{R}^7$ is a zero-mean process noise satisfying $q \sim \mathcal{N}(0,{\Sigma}_q)$, where the covariance matrix is</p><p>$$<br>\begin{align}<br>{\Sigma}<em>q=\text{diag}(0, 0, 0, \sigma_v^2, \sigma_v^2, \sigma_v^2, \sigma</em>\ell^2)\in\mathbb{R}^{7\times7}.<br>\end{align}%\label{eq_covariance_q}<br>$$</p><p>Here, $\sigma_v\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma_\ell\in\mathbb{R}$ are the standard deviations of the target’s velocity and size, respectively.<br>When the target’s shape is irregular, $\ell$ may vary when viewed from different angles.<br>By letting $\sigma_\ell\ne0$, we can handle the case where $\ell$ varies slowly.<br>The dynamic modeling of $\ell$ is discussed in the following subsection.</p><p>\subsection{Dynamic modeling of target’s physical size}<br>\label{sec_dynamical_model_of_size}</p><p>  Since the target’s physical size $\ell$ is a state variable to be estimated, it is important to discuss its dynamic model. In fact, the dynamic model of $\ell$ in \eqref{eq_state_transition} assumes that $\ell$ varies slowly. We next justify this modeling and provide more discussion.</p><p>First of all, $\ell$ corresponds to the physical size of the target object in the dimension that is orthogonal to the bearing vector. Its dynamics can be categorized into three cases.</p><p><em>1) $\ell$ is invariant.</em><br>In theory, when $\ell$ is invariant, a change of $\theta$ implies a change of $r$.<br>As a result, the measurement of $\theta$ can help improve the system’s observability, as proven in Section~\ref{sec_observability_criteria}.<br>An ideal case where $\ell$ is invariant is that the target object is a sphere or cylinder so that $\ell$ corresponds to its diameter<!--  \citep{Vrba2020} -->.<br>In practice, the target object does not have to be the ideal case. For example, consider an autonomous driving scenario where a focal vehicle uses a camera to localize its surrounding vehicles in the 2D plane.<br>Although the physical size of a surrounding vehicle changes greatly when viewed from behind or side, the height of the vehicle is <em>invariant</em> from different side-view angles.<br>In this case, $\ell$ corresponds to the height of the vehicle, and we need to use the height of the image bounding box to calculate $\theta$.</p><p><em>2) $\ell$ varies slowly.</em><br>If there does not exist any dimension in which the physical size of the target remains invariant, $\ell$ may vary slowly when the target is viewed from different angles. For example, in the tasks of aerial target pursuit, if the target is a quadcopter or hexacopter, then $\ell$ is approximately equal to the wheelbase but may vary slightly when viewed from different angles since the MAV is not a perfect cylinder.<br>In this case, $\ell$ corresponds to the wheelbase of the MAV, and we need to use the width of the image bounding box to calculate $\theta$.</p><p>If $\ell$ varies slowly, it can still be treated as invariant within short time intervals.<br>As long as the observability condition (Section~\ref{sec_observability_criteria}) is satisfied, the motion of the target as well as $\ell$ can be successfully estimated.<br>This fact is supported by the experimental results in Section~\ref{sec_sim_res_circular_scenario}.<br>It is however worth nothing that the performance of the proposed bearing-angle approach would degenerate to the conventional bearing-only one because the additional information brought by $\theta$ is used to estimate the time-varying $\ell$ rather than helping improve the system’s observability.</p><p><em>3) $\ell$ varies rapidly.</em><br>If $\ell$ varies rapidly due to certain reasons, it would be difficult to distinguish whether the change of $\theta$ is caused by the change of $\ell$ or the change of $r$.<br>For example, when a MAV is used to track a ground vehicle, $\ell$ in any dimension may vary rapidly when the relative motion between the MAV and the ground vehicle is highly dynamic.<br>In such scenarios, the additional information brought by $\theta$ is no longer sufficient to estimate the rapidly varying $\ell$ in this case. Additional visual information such as a 3D bounding box that indicates the target’s 3D attitude is required. This is an important topic for future research but out of the scope of the present paper.</p><p>\subsection{Nonlinear measurement equations}</p><p>The bearing vector $g$ and the subtended angle $\theta $ are both nonlinear functions of the target’s position.

The bearing-angle algorithm can still converge since $\ell$ varies slowly.<br>When we further increase the spinning speed of the target, the bearing-angle algorithm will also diverge because the algorithm cannot distinguish whether the change of $\theta$ is caused by the change of $\ell$ or the change of $r$.</p><p>\section{AirSim Simulation Results}\label{sec_airsim_simulation}<br>In this section, we show simulation results under a more realistic setup. In particular, the simulation is based on AirSim, a simulator that can provide high-quality visual simulation \citep{Shah2017}. Nonlinear MAV dynamics and control are also considered.</p><p>\begin{figure*}[!t]<br>\centering<br>\subfloat[The target MAV hovers stationarily, while the observer MAV approaches the target MAV under the control of \eqref{eq_tracking_control}.]{<br>\includegraphics[width=1 \linewidth]{fig_airsim_1}<br>\label{fig_airsim_1}<br>}<br>\hfill<br>\subfloat[The target MAV moves with a constant velocity, while the observer MAV follows the target MAV under the control of \eqref{eq_tracking_control}.]{<br>\includegraphics[width=1 \linewidth]{fig_airsim_2}<br>\label{fig_airsim_2}<br>}<br>\caption{AirSim simulation results in the approaching and following scenarios.}<br>\label{fig_airsim}<br>\end{figure*}</p><p>\subsection{Simulation setup}</p><p>\begin{figure*}[!t]<br>\centering<br>\subfloat[Estimation results when $\sigma_l=10^{-4}$ and the other parameters are the same as those in Section~\ref{sec_sim_res_for_tracking}.]{<br>\includegraphics[width=1 \linewidth]{fig_airsim_6_1}<br>\label{fig_airsim_6_1}<br>}<br>\hfill<br>\subfloat[Estimation results when $\sigma_l=0.01$ and the other parameters are the same as those in Section~\ref{sec_sim_res_for_tracking}.]{<br>\includegraphics[width=1 \linewidth]{fig_airsim_6_2}<br>\label{fig_airsim_6_2}<br>}<br>\caption{AirSim simulation results in the circular motion scenario where $\ell$ varies.}<br>\label{fig_airsim_6}<br>\end{figure*}</p><p>Fig.~\ref{fig_architecture_airsim} shows an AirSim simulation scenario.<br>As can be seen, there are two flying quadcopter MAVs. The observer MAV can capture images of the target MAV using its simulated onboard camera.<br>A simple gimbal camera controller is implemented so that the target MAV is always located inside the field of view of the camera.<br>The visual environment used in the simulation is called Landscape Mountains, which includes realistic mountains, lakes, trees, and roads. Other environments can also be used if needed.</p><p>The bearing and angle measurements are obtained from the bounding boxes generated by a Yolo-based detection algorithm.<br>A tiny-YOLO v4 network \citep{Bochkovskiy2020} is trained to detect the target MAV in the images. Although the visual detector can be replaced by other state-of-the-art ones, the tiny-YOLO v4 network is already sufficient to verify our proposed approach.<br>The architecture of the entire simulation system is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_box_airsim}.<br>The system consists of the modules of automatic image dataset collection, Yolo-based target detection, gimbal camera control, nonlinear quadcopter dynamics, and quadcopter flight control.<br>The quadcopter dynamics and flight control used in the simulation are similar to \citep{Meier2011, Shah2017} and omitted here due to space limitation.<br>The quadcopter’s physical size varies slightly when viewed from different directions, although it is assumed to be invariant.<br>All of these factors make the Airsim simulation more realistic and challenging.</p><p>\subsection{Automatic dataset collection}<br>To train the Yolo-based detector, we developed a module to automatically collect an image dataset.<br>This module has some advantages.<br>First, it is efficient. More than ten thousand labeled images can be collected automatically in 24 hours.<br>Second, it is flexible.<br>It can acquire images with random target’s positions, random target’s attitudes, random camera’s view angles, and random background scenes.<br>These images are beneficial to achieve a good generalization ability of the detector.<br>Third, the image labels are of high quality. Since the ground truth of the target’s image is known in the simulation, the generated bounding box is tight.<br>The collected dataset contains 17,000 labeled images (see Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_dataset}).<br>The resolution of the images is $1536\times 864$ pixels.<br>The simulation system was deployed on a Dell Precision 7920 Tower Workstation with two NVIDIA Quadro GV100 graphic cards.<br>Since the dataset is sufficient and high-quality, the detection can achieve the accuracy of mAP=99.5%.</p><p>\subsection{Scenario 1: Approaching and following the target}<br>\label{sec_sim_res_for_tracking}<br>We first consider the scenarios where the observer MAV approaches or follows a target MAV.<br>These scenarios widely exist in practical applications such as aerial target pursuit.</p><p>We show two simulation examples in Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_1} and Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_2}, respectively.<br>In both examples, the observer is controlled by a controller so that it can approach the target and maintain a desired separation. In particular, the controller is<br>\begin{align}<br>\label{eq_tracking_control}<br>v_o^\text{cmd}(t)&amp;=v_T(t)+k^\text{track}\dfrac{r^2(t)-r_d^2}{r^2(t)}g(t),<br>\end{align}<br>where $v_o^\text{cmd}(t)$ is the velocity command of the observer MAV, $k^\text{track}=3$ is the control gain, and $r_d=3$ is the desired separation.<br>The magnitude of the observer’s velocity is bounded from above by $3$~m/s.<br>It should be noted that \eqref{eq_tracking_control} relies on the true position and velocity of the target MAV in the simulation. Therefore, the data is collected first and then processed offline so that we can compare the performances of the bearing-only and bearing-angle approaches.</p><p>In the first example, the target MAV hovers constantly at $p_T(t_0)=[0, 10, 10]^\mathrm{T}$.<br>The observer MAV moves along a straight line toward the target with a decreasing velocity command.<br>Since the bearing of the target MAV remains the same, this example is challenging for the bearing-only approach.<br>As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_1}, the bearing-only approach fails to converge while the bearing-angle approach can successfully estimate the target’s motion.</p><p>In the second example, the target MAV moves with a constant velocity of $v_T=[1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{2}, 0]^\mathrm{T}$.<br>The trajectory of the observer MAV under the control of \eqref{eq_tracking_control} is still close to (though not strictly) a straight line. As a result, the observability is weak by the bearing-only approach.<br>As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_2}, the bearing-angle approach successfully converges while the bearing-only one fails.<br>It is notable that $\ell$ is invariant in the first example and varies slowly in the second example.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the detection results used in the estimation algorithms are obtained from the Yolo-based estimator.<br>The ground truth obtained from AirSim is only used to calculate the errors of measurements, as shown in the right figures of Figs.~\ref{fig_airsim_1} and \ref{fig_airsim_2}.<br>It is not surprising that the measurement noises are not strictly Gaussian since the 2D bounding box is generated by a deep learning vision algorithm. It is noticed that the noises are inversely correlated to the observer-target range.<br>This is reasonable because, when the target is close to the camera and hence its image is large, the center point and the size of the bounding box usually vary for a few pixels.</p><p>The NEES values are also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim}.<br>As can be seen, the NEES value of the bearing-only approach diverges. The NEES value of the bearing-angle approach oscillates and converges slowly. The reasons are analyzed as follows. Compared to the Matlab-based numerical simulation, the visual measurements here are generated by deep learning algorithms, and the measurement noises are non-Gaussian. The non-Gaussian noises propagate into $P$ in \eqref{eq_nees} since the calculation of $P$ relies on noisy measurements. The noises may also cause an estimation bias that can further aggravate the NEES error. Moreover, although the system is observable in the two simulation examples, the observability is relatively weak compared to the case where the observer moves surrounding the target. As a result, the matrix $P$ may not be able to perfectly describe the estimation accuracy. These elements may jointly cause the convergence behavior of the NEES values shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim}.</p><p>\subsection{Scenario 2: Circular motion and varying $\ell$}<br>\label{sec_sim_res_circular_scenario}</p><p>We next examine a case where $\ell$ is time-varying.<br>In particular, suppose a target quadcopter MAV hovers constantly at $p_T(t_0)=[0, 10, 10]^\mathrm{T}$.<br>The observer MAV moves on a circle centered at the target (Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_6_1}).<br>Since the target quadcopter MAV has a square shape from the top view, its size $\ell$ is time-varying when viewed from side angles (see the red curves in the middle subfigure of Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_6_1}).</p><p>We show two simulation examples in Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_6_1} and Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_6_2}, respectively.<br>The two simulation examples share the same measurement data but different values of $\sigma_\ell$.<br>Moreover, the other parameters are the same as those in Section~\ref{sec_sim_res_for_tracking}.</p><p>\begin{figure*}[!t]<br>\centering<br>\subfloat[Experimental setup]{<br>\includegraphics[width=0.48 \linewidth]{fig_architecture_indoor}<br>\label{fig_architecture_indoor}<br>}<br>\subfloat[Samples in the dataset]{<br>\includegraphics[width=0.48 \linewidth]{fig_car_dataset1}<br>\label{fig_car_dataset}<br>}<br>\caption{The setup of the experiments based on a hand-held camera.}<br>\end{figure*}</p><p>In the first simulation example, $\sigma_\ell$ is set to be a small value: $\sigma_\ell=10^{-4}$.<br>Its interpretation is that $\ell$ is treated as invariant during the process.<br>In this case, the performance of the bearing-angle approach is almost the same as the bearing-only one as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_airsim_6_1}.<br>Since $\ell$ is treated to be invariant, the estimated value $\hat{\ell}$ converges to a constant which is the mean value of the time-varying $\ell$.</p><p>In the second simulation example, the value of $\sigma_\ell$ is larger than the first example: $\sigma_\ell = 0.01$.<br>Its interpretation is that $\ell$ is believed to be time-varying during the process.<br>In this case, the performance of the bearing-angle approach is still almost the same as the bearing-only one.<br>Moreover, since $\sigma_\ell$ is large, the bearing-angle approach can successfully estimate the true time-varying value of $\ell$.</p><p>In summary, in the case where $\ell$ varies slowly, the bearing-angle approach would degenerate to the bearing-only one.<br>The fundamental reason is that the extra information embedded in the angle measurement is used to estimate the time-varying $\ell$ rather than improving the observability of the target’s motion.</p><p>\begin{figure*}[!t]<br>\centering<br>\subfloat[Case 1: The observer moves around the target.

The first is based on a hand-held camera and a ground robot.<br>The second is based on two quadcopter MAVs. The second experimental scenario is motivated by aerial target pursuit tasks.</p><p>\subsection{Experiment 1: Hand-held camera}</p><p>The experimental setup is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_architecture_indoor}.<br>The observer is a hand-held camera (Hik Vision DS-E14S) connected to a laptop. The camera’s intrinsic parameters are calibrated beforehand.<br>The robot built on Mecanum wheels can move in any direction on the ground under velocity control.<br>The ground truth of the states of the camera and the robot are provided by a Vicon indoor motion capture system.<br>The key experimental specifications are listed in Table~\ref{table_indoor_hardware}.</p><p>A dataset of 5,514 images was collected and used to train a tiny-YOLO v4 network to detect the target robot (see Fig.~\ref{fig_car_dataset}).<br>The detection precision of the trained network is mAP=99.8%.<br>In the experiment, the target robot is commanded to move with a constant velocity.<br>In the meantime, a person holding the camera moves along some trajectories.<br>Two different cases are studied. In both of the cases, the target robot moves with a constant velocity $v_T=[-0.1, 0.1 ,0]^\mathrm{T}$.<br>The noises of the measurements are calculated based on the ground truth provided by the Vicon system. The noises are shown in the right subfigures of Fig.~\ref{fig_indoor_9} and Fig.~\ref{fig_indoor_6}.</p><p>In the first case, the camera is held about 1.5 meters above the ground and moves around the target robot. In this case, the bearing vector varies sufficiently and hence the observability conditions for the bearing-only and bearing-angle approaches are both well satisfied. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_indoor_9}, both approaches perform well in this case while the bearing-angle approach performs slightly better than the bearing-only one.</p><p>In the second case, the camera moves along the trajectory of the robot by getting close or far from it periodically.<br>In this case, the angle varies significantly, but the bearing does not.<br>Without surprise, the bearing-only approach performs poorly in this case due to weak observability  (Fig.~\ref{fig_indoor_6}).<br>By contrast, the bearing-angle approach can perform stably due to its enhanced observability.<br>\begin{table}<br>\begin{center}<br>\caption{Key specifications of the \emph{indoor} hardware system.}<br>\label{table_indoor_hardware}<br>\begin{tabular}{l|lll}<br>\hline<br>&amp; Parameter &amp; Value &amp; Unit \<br>\hline<br>\multirow{2}<em>{Camera} &amp; Resolution &amp; 640$\times$ 480 &amp; pixel\<br>~ &amp; Max frequency &amp; 30 &amp;fps\<br>\hline<br>\multirow{2}</em>{Robot} &amp; Max speed &amp; 1&amp; m/s \<br>~ &amp; Diameter size &amp; 295 &amp; mm\<br>\hline<br>\multirow{2}*{Vicon} &amp; Localization accuracy &amp; 1 &amp; mm \<br>~ &amp; Max frequency &amp; 100 &amp; Hz\<br>\hline<br>\end{tabular}<br>\end{center}<br>\end{table}</p><p>\subsection{Experiment 2: MAV-following-MAV}<br>\label{sec_mav_following_mav}</p><p>\begin{table}<br>\begin{center}<br>\caption{Key specifications of the \emph{outdoor} hardware system.}<br>\label{table_M300}<br>\begin{tabular}{c|lll}<br>\hline<br>&amp; Parameter &amp; Value &amp; Unit \<br>\hline<br>\multirow{5}{<em>}{\makecell[c]{M300 \quadcopter}} &amp; Diagonal size &amp; 895 &amp; mm\<br>~&amp;Total mass &amp; 7.4 &amp; kg \<br>~&amp;Max pitch/roll &amp; 30 &amp; degree \<br>~&amp;Max flight time &amp; 30 &amp; minutes\<br>\hline<br>\multirow{2}{</em>}{RTK} &amp; Accuracy &amp; 1 &amp; cm \<br>~&amp; Max frequency &amp; 10 &amp; Hz\<br>\hline<br>\multirow{3}{*}{\makecell[c]{H20 \ gimbal &amp; \ camera} } &amp; Resolution &amp;1920$\times$1080  &amp; pixel\<br>~&amp; Frequency &amp; 15 &amp; Hz \<br>~ &amp; Max angular rate &amp; 180 &amp; deg/s\<br>\hline<br>\end{tabular}<br>\end{center}<br>\end{table}</p><p>\begin{figure*}[!t]<br>\centering<br>\subfloat[Hardware platforms]{<br>\includegraphics[width=0.48 \linewidth]{fig_M300}<br>\label{fig_M300}<br>}<br>\subfloat[Samples of the images in the dataset]{<br>\includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{fig_M300_dataset1}<br>\label{fig_M300_dataset}<br>}<br>\hfill<br>\subfloat[System architecture]{<br>\includegraphics[width=0.48 \linewidth]{fig_outdoor_hardware}<br>\label{fig_outdoor_hardware}<br>}<br>\caption{The setup of the MAV-following-MAV experiment.}<br>\end{figure*}</p><p>\begin{figure*}[!t]<br>\centering<br>\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig_outdoor_1}<br>\caption{The results of the MAV-following-MAV experiments. The bearing-angle approach performs effectively, but the bearing-only approach works unstably.}<br>\label{fig_outdoor_1}<br>\end{figure*}</p><p>Two MAV platforms were developed based on DJI M300 quadcopters (Fig.~\ref{fig_M300}).<br>The MAV platforms are equipped with RTK GPS modules for accurate self-localization, an H20 camera for visual detection, a Manifold 2G onboard computer for onboard flight control, and a Zigbee module for wireless communication.<br>Some key specifications of the MAV platforms are listed in Table~\ref{table_M300}.<br>The structure of the hardware perception and communication system is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig_outdoor_hardware}.<br>The target MAV is also equipped with an RTK GPS module, whose measurements are used as the ground truth to calculate the noises of the visual measurements. The noises are shown in the right subfigure of Fig.~\ref{fig_outdoor_1}.</p><p>The experiment consists of two stages: data acquisition and offline data processing.<br>In the data acquisition stage, the target MAV is commanded to fly with a constant velocity, and the observer MAV is automatically controlled to follow the target MAV to maintain a constant distance from the target.<br>More specifically, the procedure of the flight experiment is as follows. Initially, the observer MAV is placed about 20 meters behind the target MAV on the ground. Then, the two MAVs take off and fly to the same specified height automatically upon a takeoff command sent from the ground control station.<br>After they have reached the desired height, all deployed algorithms are activated.<br>Then, the target MAV moves with a constant velocity of $v_T=[1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{2}, 0]^\mathrm{T}$. The observer MAV approaches the target by the controller in \eqref{eq_tracking_control}. It takes the observer MAV about eight seconds to reach the desired relative distance.<br>Then, the two MAVs fly with the same velocity and remain relatively stationary for another 20 seconds.<br>Finally, the ground station sends a stop command and the two MAVs return and land automatically.</p><p>During the flight, the gimbal camera of the observer MAV is automatically controlled so that the target MAV is maintained in the field of view.<br>It is noted that the control of the gimbal camera and the observer MAV is not based on the visual detection results. Instead, the control is based on the measurements provided by the RKT GPS and inter-MAV wireless communication. In this way, we can analyze the image and flight data offline and compare the performance of the two approaches of bearing-angle and bearing-only.<br>The acquired images and flight data are saved on the onboard computer during the flight. A dataset of 5,341 images was collected (Fig.~\ref{fig_M300_dataset}) and used to train a tiny-YOLO v4 network.<br>The detection precision of the trained network reaches mAP=99.8%.</p><p>The experimental results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_outdoor_1}.<br>As can be seen, the bearing-angle approach performs well. By contrast, the bearing-only approach only works well before the observer MAV reached the desired position relative to the target MAV. That is because the bearing varies significantly during this process due to the fluctuation of the observer’s motion caused by the flight control. However, the bearing-only approach diverges quickly thereafter when the bearing stops varying significantly.</p><p>\section{Conclusion}\label{section_conclusion}<br>Motivated by the limitation of the existing bearing-only approach, this paper proposed and analyzed a novel bearing-angle approach for vision-based target motion estimation. We showed that the observability by the bearing-angle approach is significantly enhanced compared to the bearing-only one.<br>As a result, the requirement of the observer’s extra motion for observability enhancement can be significantly relaxed.<br>As we showed in various experiments, the bearing-angle approach can successfully estimate the target’s motion in many scenarios where the bearing-only approach fails.<br>The enhanced observability of the bearing-angle approach comes with no additional cost since almost all vision detection algorithms can generate bounding boxes.<br>One assumption adopted in the bearing-angle approach is that the target’s physical size is invariant to different viewing angles. Although this assumption is approximately valid in many tasks as demonstrated in this paper, it is meaningful to study how to relax or remove this assumption in the future.</p><p>%\section*{Acknowledgements}<br>%The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the editors for their helpful advice for improving this work.</p><p>\section*{Declaration of conflicting interests}<br>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p><p>\section*{Funding}<br>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this artical: This work was supported by the Hangzhou Key Technology Research and Development Program (Grant 20212013B09), and the Research Center for Industries of the Future at Westlake University (Grant WU2022C027).</p><p>\bibliographystyle{SageH}<br>%\bibliographystyle{SageV}<br>\bibliography{paper}</p><p>\end{document}</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1><a href="./20240224d.html#%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E7%88%B1%E8%8E%89%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%9A%E5%B1%80%E9%95%BF%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%9B%9E%E5%BF%86">文学导航</a></h1><blockquote><p>警察局档案编号：2024-01-11-001</p><p>档案名称：关于爱莉西亚局长的个人回忆</p><p>档案作者：英仙座，警察局副局长</p></blockquote><p>  我与爱莉西亚局长的相识，要追溯到三年前的一起奇怪的案件。当时，我还是一个银行劫匪，和我的同伙一起策划了一次大规模的抢劫。我们打算在杰拉德·弗雷泽的银行里装上炸弹，然后趁着混乱，抢走所有的钱。我们以为我们的计划十分完美，没想到，遇到了爱莉西亚，也因此认识了银行家。</p><p>  她当时还不是局长，只是一个刚刚调来的刑警，负责调查一起涉及黑社会的枪击案。她恰巧在那家银行里，发现了我们的炸弹，就立刻通知了警方，然后冲进了我们的藏身处，一个接一个地把我们制服了。她的动作十分迅速，几乎没有给我们反应的机会。我是最后一个被她抓住的，她用枪指着我的头，说：“你们这些无耻的家伙，竟敢威胁无辜的人民，应该受到惩罚。”她的眼神十分冷酷，让我感到一阵寒意。</p><p>  但是，就在她准备扣动扳机的时候，她突然停住了，她的眼神变得柔和，她说：“不过，你还有救赎的机会，你可以选择跟我走，或者留在这里等死。”我不知道她为什么会突然改变主意，也不知道她要带我去哪里，但是我觉得我没有别的选择，就跟着她走了。</p><p>  从那以后，我就成了爱莉西亚局长的得力助手，也是她唯一的朋友。她对我很好，总是给我讲一些有趣的故事，还教我一些奇怪的知识。她说她是从一个叫做 “逐火之蛾” 的组织来的，那里有很多奇妙的事物，还有一些她的战友。</p><p>  我不知道她说的这些是真是假，但我觉得她很可信，也很有魅力。她在工作上很有能力，能够迅速解决各种棘手的案件，还能和各方打好关系。她在生活上很有趣，经常拉着我去逛街，让我帮她挑选衣服和化妆品，有时候我心不在焉，她又会拉着我的手对我说：“你快对我说，艾莉西亚穿什么都好看，好不好嘛？”有时候她也会拉着我去看恐怖电影，演到吓人的场景时她也会害怕的缩成一团，和之前勇敢无畏的局长判若两人。虽然我也很害怕，但还是会摸摸她的头，对她说：“我会永远保护你的。”而她会趁机靠在我的肩膀上说：“你可真是我的小英雄！”</p><p><img src="https://picture.adunas.top/Article/ElysiaA.png" alt=""></p><p>  有一次我们解决了哈山的案子，中间和她分开了一段时间，结果听到她的一声惨叫，但是当我过来之后她只是一脸笑意的看着我，手上拿着一个奇怪的怀表。之后的日子里她有时候会突然消失一段时间，然后又突然出现在我的面前，她从不告诉我她去了哪里，做了什么，只是笑着说：“你不用担心，我只是有些私事要办。”我总是觉得她在隐瞒什么，但我不敢多问，只是默默地等待她的归来，只觉得她有一种神奇的力量。</p><p>  她经常让我陪她去一些危险的地方，说是为了调查一些案件，其实是为了寻找她的秘密。她总是让我遇到各种麻烦，比如被黑社会追杀，被邪恶的力量感染，等等。她每次都会在最后一刻出现，救我一命，然后对我说：“你真是个笨蛋，怎么总是让自己陷入危险，你不知道我有多担心你吗？”她的语气总是带着一种嘲讽，让我觉得她是在故意捉弄我，但是她的眼神却又充满了关切，让我觉得她是在真心保护我。我不知道她到底是怎么想的，但是我总是感激她，也总是原谅她。</p><p>  直到那一天，一切都改变了。那是一天晚上，我们在现场发现了一个小女孩，爱莉西亚看到她，就惊呼了一声，说：“是你！”然后，她就冲上去，抱住了那个女孩。接下来的事情，我就记不太清楚了。我只记得爱莉西亚局长和那个女孩说了一些话，然后她就对我说：“对不起，我要走了，我有很重要的事情要做，和她有关。”我问她要去哪里，她说：“去一个你无法跟随的地方，去完成我的使命。”而我无法抛下她不管，还是偷偷跟了过去。</p><p>  中间撕掉了很多页（）</p><p>  那一天的场景仍然无数次的出现在我的梦里，我仿佛置身充满了恐怖和绝望的地方，让人只能感受到疯狂和死亡。那里有无数的黑暗，无数的怪物，无数的尖叫，无数的血肉。那里没有光明，没有生命，没有希望，没有意义，没有规则。那里只有一个无尽的混沌，一个无边的疯狂，一个无名的恐惧，一个无法的崩坏。</p><p>  我只记得最后，艾莉西亚对我说：“傻瓜，你还是跟过来了呀，我的小英雄。”</p><details class="folding-tag" orange><summary> 点击查看语录 </summary>              <div class='content'>              <p><span class='p green'>&gt;</span> 粉色头发的迷人女孩是谁呀，哦，原来是我呀！<span class='p green'>&lt;</span></p><div class="audio"><audio controls preload><source src='https://picture.adunas.top/Audio/%E7%88%B1%E8%8E%89%E5%B8%8C%E9%9B%85-%E8%AF%B4%E8%B5%B7%E7%B2%89%E8%89%B2%E5%A4%B4%E5%8F%91%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%AF%E7%88%B1%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%A9%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%A0%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E4%BC%9A%E6%83%B3%E5%88%B0%E8%B0%81%EF%BC%9F%E4%B8%89%E4%BA%8C%E4%B8%80%E5%9B%9E%E7%AD%94%E3%80%82.mp3' type='audio/mp3'>Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio></div><p><span class='p green'>&gt;</span> 多夸夸我嘛，我会很开心的~<span class='p green'>&lt;</span></p><div class="audio"><audio controls preload><source src='https://picture.adunas.top/Audio/%E7%88%B1%E8%8E%89%E5%B8%8C%E9%9B%85-%E5%97%A8%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E5%8F%88%E6%9D%A5%E5%95%A6%E3%80%82%E5%A4%9A%E5%A4%B8%E5%A4%B8%E6%88%91%E5%A5%BD%E5%90%97%EF%BC%9F%E6%88%91%E4%BC%9A%E5%BE%88%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E5%BC%80%E5%BF%83%E7%9A%84%E5%93%A6%E3%80%82.mp3' type='audio/mp3'>Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio></div><p><span class='p green'>&gt;</span> 可爱的少女心，可是无所不能的哦！<span class='p green'>&lt;</span></p><div class="audio"><audio controls preload><source src='https://picture.adunas.top/Audio/%E4%BA%BA%E4%B9%8B%E5%BE%8B%E8%80%85-%E5%91%B5...%E7%9C%8B%EF%BC%8C%E5%8F%AF%E7%88%B1%E7%9A%84%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3%E5%BF%83%E5%8F%AF%E6%98%AF%E6%97%A0%E6%89%80%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E7%9A%84%E5%93%A6%E3%80%82.mp3' type='audio/mp3'>Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio></div>              </div>            </details>]]></content>
